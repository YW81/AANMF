# AANMF

Adaptive Affinity Learning NMF

Code in Matlab for the paper "Adaptive Affinity Learning for Accurate Community Detection (ICDM 2018)". The implementation has invoked the algorithms proposed in "A non-monotonic method for large-scale non-negative least squares" and "A feasible method for optimization with orthogonality constraints".

Check AANMF.m for the main program.
